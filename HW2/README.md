# HW2

## Introduction
This homework will guide you through the process of training an end-to-end driving model and assessing its performance using the Town 05 Long benchmark in CARLA.

## Setup

Download and setup CARLA 0.9.10.1, please refer to the instructions in HW0. 

Clone this repo and build the environment
```
cd HW2
conda env create -f environment.yml --name HW2
conda activate HW2
```

```
export PYTHONPATH=$PYTHONPATH:PATH_TO_HW2
```

## Dataset

Download our dataset through [GoogleDrive](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1HZxlSZ_wUVWkNTWMXXcSQxtYdT7GogSm/view?usp=sharing). The total size of our dataset is aroung 130G, make sure you have enough space.

## Training
First, set the dataset path in ``e2e_driving/config.py``.
Training:
```
python e2e_driving/train.py --gpus NUM_OF_GPUS
```
Please check ``e2e_driving/train.py`` for other arguments usage (epochs, learning rate, batch size, etc.), data processing and loss function.

Check training curve.
```
tensorboard --logdir ./log
```
## Evaluation
First, launch the carla server,
```
cd CARLA_ROOT
./CarlaUE4.sh --world-port=2000 -opengl
```
Set the carla path, model ckpt for evaluation in ``leaderboard/scripts/run_evaluation.sh``.

Note that we will save some data for visualization, 
please check ``self.save(tick_data)`` in ``e2e_driving/vision_agent.py``

Start the evaluation.
```
sh leaderboard/scripts/run_evaluation.sh
```

Parse the results from ``results_VA.json`` (Please check [here](https://leaderboard.carla.org/#evaluation-and-metrics) for metric description.)
```
python e2e_driving/statistics.py
```
